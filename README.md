2. Bill proposals go through field validation before admin review.
3. Bill voting includes upvotes and downvotes.
4. Bills reaching a certain upvote threshold are sent for admin review.
5. Admins can accept, reject, or suggest changes to bills.
6. Users can comment on bills and articles.
7. A recommendation algorithm suggests relevant content to users.
8. The app tracks likes and dislikes on articles and comments.
